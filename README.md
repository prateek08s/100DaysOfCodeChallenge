# 100DaysOfCodeChallenge
I have committed to coding for at least an hour every day for 100 days as part of the #100DaysOfCodeChallenge. I am doing this challenge to improve my coding skills and build a habit of consistent coding. I will be documenting my progress on this GitHub repository and sharing it on LinkedIn using the hashtag #100DaysOfCodeChallenge.
